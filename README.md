Fitting a GIF neural model with voltage-dependent potassium current to data

This code builds upon the code found in https://github.com/pozzorin/GIFFittingToolbox  It implements a GIF (Generalized Integrate-and-Fire, a close cousin of GLM and SRM) neuron model with subthreshold voltage-dependent potassium current, and fits its parameters to experimental data. The potassium current appears as an added term in the total current of the basic GIF model.

The main methods used in this code are a multilinear regression for the subthreshold parameters and maximum likelihood for matching the model spike initiation parameters to spiking data.

The core code has been created by Christian Pozzorini, Skander Mensi and Richard Naud from EPFL. The fitting protocol has been designed by Richard Naud, C. Pozzorini and S. Mensi under the supervision of Wulfram Gerstner.
